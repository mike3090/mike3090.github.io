# mike3090.github.io/blogs
As the name itself describes!

Before using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the `html` file writing by my own looks like this:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <title>
        Header
    </title>
    <body>
        <h1>Hi! This is the personal site of @mike3090.</h1>
        Hi! I'm @mike3090, a student at Shanghaitech University.<br>
        Interests: Interactive Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Visualization.<br>
        But all of them above now really make me stressful.<br>
        This website is about to be decorated soon with some templates. Then we will wave to say goodbye to this ugly simple website!<br>
    </body>
</html>
